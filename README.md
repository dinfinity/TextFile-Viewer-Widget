# Textfile Viewer Widget
An Android widget to display a (part of a) text file in a widget, developed for personal use a long time ago.

This code is not actively maintained by me, may or may not be updated, nor has a reasonable attempt been made to make the code pretty, the widget user-friendly or the widget functioning properly on other devices than my own. If you are a programmer, you may find it useful as a starting point.

This project contains code from other open source projects, for which their licensing applies.
